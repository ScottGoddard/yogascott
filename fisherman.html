				<p>We are here to assist you. Our trainers have the ability to share their unique skills in angling. Review our how-to schedule.<br><br>
				One of the most beneficial gifts you can give yourself as an angler is to gain more knowledge about the sport. 
				Understanding what you should be doing and where you should be doing it… will hook more fish for you in the 
				future than any lure you’ll buying from some “pitch man” at a boat show. Naturally, there are lots of sources 
				to obtain information on inshore fishing; such as books, magazines, videos, blogs, and of course the old “trial & error” 
				method. But what if you could get the benefit of years of pro level experience; from an instructor who’s fished all 
				over the Gulf Coast and Caribbean as a pro angler and a guide? And receive all of this material in an easy to understand 
				yet dynamic power-point presentation and hands-on experience?
