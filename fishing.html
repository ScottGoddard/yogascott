			<h2>Fishing</h2>
				<p>Each class location features 6 current or former deep water fishing 
				top-level tournament anglers, who will present a total of 8 seminars. Each seminar 
				is 45+ minutes and covers cutting-edge deep water fishing tactics, techniques, and tackle. 
				The seminars are 2-day events, but individual days can be purchased when 
				selecting ticket options. Discounts are available for anglers 17 and under. Additionally, 
				all students receive a loaded gift bag full of valuable tackle and special offers from our sponsors.
				<br><br>
				The shallow water wrecks provide fishing not found anywhere else in Florida. The wrecks create 
				an artificial reef system. The fish are sometimes lured to the surface with live baits and teased 
				into a frenzy where an artificial lure may be placed in front of the very fish that you choose. 
				This technique has produced several world record Amberjacks, Barracudas and Cobia over the years. 
				This is a highly visual and exciting type of Florida deep sea fishing charters, particularly on 
				light tackle. In other popular fishing locations, it's unlikely to see what you're fishing for 
				when it comes to bottom fishing Grouper and bottom fishing Snapper.
